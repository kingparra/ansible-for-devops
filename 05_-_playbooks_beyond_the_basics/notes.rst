**********************************************
Chapter 5: Ansible playbooks beyond the basics
**********************************************


Handlers
--------
Here's a simple example of a handler from the last playbook.

::

  handlers:

    - name: restart apache
      service: name=apache2 state=restarted

  tasks:

    - name: Enable Apache rewrite module.
      apache2_module: name=rewrite state=present
      notify: restart apache

To notify multiple handlers you can use a list argument for the notify option.

One handler can notify another handler, creating a chain.

::

  handlers:

    - name: restart apache
      service: name=apache2 state=restarted
      notify: restart memcached

    - name: restart memcached
      service: name=memcached state=restarted

Some things to be aware of when using handlers:

* Handlers will only be run if a task notifies the handler.

* Handlers will run once, and only once, at the end of a play.

* If the play fails on a host before handlers are notified,
  the handlers will never be run.

* If a task runs but there are no changes the handler will not be notified.

You can force execution of the handlers with the
``ansible-playbook ... --force-handlers`` option.


Environment variables
---------------------

Per-task environment variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You can set environment variables for use in a single task
with the ``environment`` keyword::

  - name: Download a file, using example-proxy as a proxy.
    get_url:
      url: http://www.example.com/file.tar.gz
      dest: ~/Downloads/
    environment:
      http_proxy: http://example-proxy:80/

Here's an example where a group of variables are factored out::

	vars:
		proxy_vars:
			http_proxy: http://example-proxy:80/
			https_proxy: https://example-proxy:443/
		[etc...]

	tasks:
		- name: Download a file, using example-proxy as a proxy.
			get_url:
				url: http://www.example.com/file.tar.gz
				dest: ~/Downloads/
			environment: proxy_vars

Persistent environment variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You can of course set environment variables using built-in OS facilities.
I have some notes on that here:
https://gist.github.com/kingparra/a2075d427fad2b0e313fec34d3a2baa1

Here is an example of editing the ``/etc/environment`` file using the
``lineinfile`` module::

  vars:
    proxy_state: present
  tasks:
    - name: Configure the proxy.
      lineinfile:
        dest: /etc/environment
        regexp: "{{item.regexp}}"
        line:   "{{item.line}}"
        state:  "{{proxy_state}}"
      with_items:
        - regexp: "^http_proxy="
          line:   "http_proxy=http://example-proxy:80/"
        - regexp: "^https_proxy="
          line:   "https_proxy=https://example-proxy:80/"
        - regexp: "^ftp_proxy="
          line:   "ftp_proxy=http://example-proxy:80/"


Variables
---------
The goal of this section is to show many examples of setting and retrieving
variable values, in varous different locations.

You can set variables in at least 22 different
locations. How do you know which variable definition
takes precedence?

In general, Ansible gives precedence to variables that
were defined more recently, more actively, and with
more explicit scope.

Ansible has three main scopes:

* Global: this is set by config, environment vars, and the cli.
* Play: each play and contained structures, var entries, role defaults and vars.
* Host: vars directly associated to a host, like inventory, includ_vars, facts or registered task outputs.

Command-line::

  ansible-playbook example.yaml --extra-vars "foo=bar"

  ansible-playbook example.yaml --extra-vars "@even_more_vars.yaml"

  ansible-playbook example.yaml --extra-vars "@even_more_vars.json"

Playbook::

  ---
  - hosts: example
    vars:
      foo: bar
    tasks:
      - name: some task, bro
        ...

  ---
  - hosts: all
    vars_prompt:
      - name: username
        prompt: What is your username?
        private: false
      - name: password
        prompt: What is your password?

    tasks:
      - name: Print a message
        ansible.builtin.debug:
          msg: 'Logging in as {{ username }}'

  ---
  - hosts: example
    vars_files:
      - vars.yaml
    tasks:
      - name: some task, bro
        ...

  ---
  - hosts: example
    pre_tasks:
      - include_vars: "{{item}}"
        with_first_found:
          # lets assume you have multiple files with this naming convention
          # the ansible_os_family identifier is an ansible _fact_.
          - "apache_{{ansible_os_family}}.yml"
          - "apache_default.yml"
    tasks:
      - name: Ensure apache is running.
        service:
          # depends on which os_family is interpolated into varsfile name
          name: "{{apache_service_name}}"
          state: running

Inventory::

  [washington]
  app1.example.com proxy_state=present

  [washington:vars]
  cdn_host=washington.static.example.com
  api_version=3.0.1

Using automatically loaded ``(host|group)_vars`` files (eg ./group_vars/washington)::

  ---
  # these vars will be applied to all hosts in the washington group
  foo: bar
  baz: qux

Registering the output of a task as a new variable::

  - name: "Node: Check list of Node.js apps running."
    command: forever list
    register: forever_list
    changed_when: false

  - name: "Node: Start example Node.js app."
    command: forever start {{node_apps_location}}/app/app.js
    when: "forever_list.stdout.find(node_apps_location + '/app/app.js') == 1"

Accessing a registered variable::

  # Ansible uses the Jinja2 templating library to
  # interpolate variables into strings.

  # Strings
  #########
  "/opt/my-app/rebuild {{my_environment}}"

  # Lists
  ########
  # Get the first element of a list
  {{ foo[0] }}

  # Dicts/Objects
  ###############
  # If you use the attribute reference operator, the attribute name
  # must be a valid identifier (no special chars), and cannot be a dunder.
  # Dunders are names like __init__, __mult__, or __whatever_maann__.
  {{ ansible_eth0.ipv4.address }}

  # Use the subscript operator if your keys not valid identifiers,
  # or are dunders, or shadow any of the known public attribute names.
  {{ ansible_eth0['ipv4']['address'] }}

  # Jinja2 filters
  ################
  https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_filters.html#playbooks-filters

Ansible defines a magic ``hostvars`` variable
containing all the defined host vars from all sources.


Advanced syntax
---------------

Escaping Jinja2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you want to prevent Jinja2 from interpolating
values, you can use the unsafe type.

::

  ---
  mypass: !unsafe 234%234{435lkj{{lkjsdf

This is more comprehensive than excaping with
``{% raw %} ... {% endraw %}``.

You can mark values supplied by ``vars_prompt`` as
unsafe.

YAML anchors and aliases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You define an anchor with &, then refer to it using an
alias, denoted with ``*``.

Hereâ€™s an example that sets three values with an
anchor, uses two of those values with an alias, and
overrides the third value:

::

  ---
  ...
  vars:
      app1:
          jvm: &jvm_opts
              opts: '-Xms1G -Xmx2G'
              port: 1000
              path: /usr/lib/app1
      app2:
          jvm:
              <<: *jvm_opts
              path: /usr/lib/app2
  ...

The value for path is merged by ``<<`` or merge operator.
